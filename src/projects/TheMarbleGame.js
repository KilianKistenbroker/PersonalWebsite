            This project is a primitive version of the
            <b> Mobile Platformer Game</b> and features its own 2d game engine
            that I programmed in Java using Android Studio, which was developed
            as a personal project during my first year at university for android
            devices. The primary goal behind this endeavor was to deepen my
            understanding of programming concepts through the lens of game
            development, and therefore lacks a thorough development cycle. As of
            now, I do not have plans to continue developing this project in the
            near future. It remains a valuable learning experience and a
            snapshot of my early programming journey. Although the engine I
            wrote is very specific to my game, the code within the repository is
            available for anyone who finds it useful for their own projects,
            learning, or inspiration. Feel free to explore, modify, and
            incorporate any part of it into your work.
